Establishing a VPN PPTP/L2TP is complete!

You can connect to the Internet:
1) Using the shortcut on the Desktop;
2) Start Menu-> Internet-> ponoff (Manage connection VPN PPTP/L2TP) or Menu-> Utilities-> System-> ponoff (Manage connection VPN PPTP/L2TP);
3) After completing an administrator under the command ponoff;
This configuration can also be called by root of command vpnpptp or from the Menu-> Internet-> vpnpptp (Setting up connection VPN PPTP/L2TP) or from Menu-> Utilities-> System-> vpnpptp (Setting up connection VPN PPTP/L2TP);
4) Holds under root of the command /usr/sbin/pppd call connection_name (in this case, the VPN will work without a GUI).

If the connection is properly configured - run this configuration again. Make sure the data.
If you do not see the shortcut icon on the Desktop, then refresh the desktop (F5).

Manage connections to the Internet you can use the icon in the system tray by clicking the right mouse button.
Proposed 2 options out of the program:
1) to return to the state, which was originally to run the VPN, you can only if there are no accidents on the line;
2) if the accident on the line, you should just quit and stay in the current network status.
The connection is automatically installed during the time of dialing. If it is during this time is not established, then made a second attempt to establish a connection during the time of dial-up etc. The program can automatically restore the connection in case of accidents, but also temporarily switch to other network interfaces in the accident.
If the connection is established, but the Internet does not work, check your firewall (or disable it altogether).
